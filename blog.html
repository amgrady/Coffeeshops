            <p class="lead card-text text-shadow text-white w-50 d-none d-lg-block">Inkwell’s Gingerbread Latte was absolutely delicious; sip after sip it tasted like a perfectly-made gingerbread man cookie. It was very sweet, making it the perfect latte for the Christmas season. They had a small selection of specialty drinks and syrups, but the ones they did have proved to exceptional. Their prices are similar to those of the local coffee shops. </p>

            <p class="lead card-text text-shadow text-white w-50 d-none d-lg-block">Hopscotch’s black coffee/cold brews are reasonable priced, and well-flavored; however, when you start to dive into the speciality drinks, the selection lowers and the prices rise. They have a few syrups to choose from, but you won’t find much variety. The price is high for the quantity given. If you like old-fashioned coffee, like americanos and cappuccinos, this is the place for you!</p>

There’s a wide variety of brews to choose from, and the coffee is high quality. The standard coffee drinks are all made well, and they have a large selection of unique specialty drinks as well as several types of loose-leaf teas, freshly-squeezed juices, and fruit smoothies. Whether you like black coffee or caramel macchiatos, Soma has something for you!</p>

            <p class="lead card-text text-shadow text-white w-50 d-none d-lg-block">Starbucks’ cold brews/black coffee are classic and brewed well. They also have a specialty cold brew with coconut milk, which is a rather unique addition. However, the cold brews do tend to be on the pricier side. The black coffee is reasonably priced, especially if you’re a gold member and can reap the reward of free refills. </p>

            <p class="lead card-text text-shadow text-white w-50 d-none d-lg-block">This drink included honey, caramel, and hazelnut, and it was as delicious as it sounds! This specialty drink was better than expected, and at a reasonable price. It was the perfect mix of both the espresso and the different flavors, while also beautiful presented. This drink was unanimously voted as the best specialty drink.</p>

            <p class="lead card-text text-shadow text-white w-50 d-none d-lg-block">Though this drink was black coffee, and not what we expected, I was really impressed by it. I could taste each individual flavor in the roast, especially the caramel and apple. The presentation of the drink was especially unique because they gave us the coffee in a mug, but the extra was given to us in a chemical flask. We watched them measure everything and prepare it elaborately, which is no doubt part of the reason Needmore had the best black coffee I had in Bloomington.

            <p class="lead card-text text-shadow text-white w-50 d-none d-lg-block">TThe Pourhouse’s caramel macchiato is mediocre. The caramel and vanilla flavors were just not that great. I was very disappointed by this speciality drink, as I expected better from a place with such a great reputation. Personally, I enjoyed the muffin more than the drink itself. </p>
